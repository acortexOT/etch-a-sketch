//Loop createElement for 16*16 div with class 'item [i]', (get width and safe as max)
//hover eventListener triggers function 
    //if no color: that randomly assigns RBG background color to item
    //if color: increases darkness by 10%
//button triggers NewGrid function
    //prompt asks user to input number of squares per side for new grid
    //input is checked for being number less than 101
        //if true: deletes all divs from container and loops divs with entered number
        //if number but less than 100, cheeky prompt to retry with smaller number, between 10-100
        //elseif not a number: than prompt to retry using a number between 10 - 100
